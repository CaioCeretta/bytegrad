# 6 - Prisma Pulse

We can have a database and that database can be updated by multplice places, if some service is updating our database, maybe
adding an expense, in this particular app i would like to be notified by that, and we can use pisma pulse to be notified
of those events in our  database, so if, for example, one application makes a update in the database, the database receives
that event, and then prisa pulse will stream it to my app.
